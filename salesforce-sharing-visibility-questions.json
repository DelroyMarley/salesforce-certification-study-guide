    {
      "id": 1,
      "topic": "Org-Wide Defaults",
      "question": "A company has a private OWD for Opportunities. Sales reps should only see their own opportunities, but sales managers need to see all opportunities owned by reps in their region. What is the most efficient solution?",
      "options": [
        "A. Create criteria-based sharing rules for each region",
        "B. Use role hierarchy with managers above their regional reps",
        "C. Create public groups and owner-based sharing rules",
        "D. Use Apex managed sharing with a custom reason"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Role hierarchy is the most efficient and maintainable solution. Users automatically gain read access to records owned by users below them in the hierarchy when OWD is Private. This requires no additional configuration beyond proper role assignment."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "topic": "Sharing Rules",
      "question": "Which statement about criteria-based sharing rules is TRUE?",
      "options": [
        "A. They can share records based on the record owner's role",
        "B. They can grant Full Access (Read/Write/Delete)",
        "C. They can be used with any field type including formula fields",
        "D. They evaluate record field values to determine sharing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Criteria-based sharing rules share records based on field values in the record (e.g., Region__c = 'West'). They cannot reference owner information (that's owner-based rules), cannot grant delete access, and have limitations on supported field types."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "topic": "Implicit Sharing",
      "question": "A user owns a Contact but cannot see the parent Account. What type of access does the user have to the Account?",
      "options": [
        "A. No access",
        "B. Read-only access through parent implicit sharing",
        "C. Read-only access through child implicit sharing",
        "D. Read/Write access through implicit sharing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Child implicit sharing grants Read-only access to a parent Account when a user owns a related Contact or Opportunity. This ensures users can always see the context for records they own."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "topic": "Teams",
      "question": "A company wants to allow Account owners to share their accounts with specific colleagues on a case-by-case basis. The sharing should persist even if the Account owner changes. What should be implemented?",
      "options": [
        "A. Account Teams",
        "B. Manual Sharing",
        "C. Apex Managed Sharing",
        "D. Public Groups with Sharing Rules"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Apex Managed Sharing persists regardless of owner changes when using a custom Apex sharing reason. Account Teams and Manual Sharing are both deleted when ownership changes. Public Groups with Sharing Rules wouldn't provide case-by-case flexibility."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "topic": "Territory Management",
      "question": "Which object does Enterprise Territory Management primarily use to assign records to territories?",
      "options": [
        "A. Account",
        "B. Opportunity",
        "C. Lead",
        "D. Contact"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Enterprise Territory Management assigns Accounts to territories. Opportunities inherit territory assignment from their parent Account. Leads and Contacts are not directly assignable to territories."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "topic": "Apex Managed Sharing",
      "question": "A developer needs to create an Apex sharing record. Which object should they insert a record into for a custom object called Project__c?",
      "options": [
        "A. Project__Share",
        "B. Project__c__Share",
        "C. ProjectShare",
        "D. Project__c.Share"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "The sharing object for custom objects follows the pattern ObjectName__Share (removing the __c suffix). For Project__c, the sharing object is Project__Share."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "topic": "Role Hierarchy",
      "question": "What happens when 'Grant Access Using Hierarchies' is disabled for a custom object?",
      "options": [
        "A. The OWD automatically changes to Private",
        "B. Users higher in the role hierarchy lose automatic access to records below them",
        "C. Sharing rules stop functioning for that object",
        "D. The object cannot use manual sharing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Disabling 'Grant Access Using Hierarchies' prevents automatic access inheritance through the role hierarchy. This is useful when sensitive data shouldn't flow up (e.g., HR records). OWD, sharing rules, and manual sharing continue to function normally."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "topic": "Sharing Architecture",
      "question": "A company has 50 million Account records. Running sharing rule recalculation is taking too long. Which approach would help?",
      "options": [
        "A. Convert criteria-based sharing rules to owner-based sharing rules",
        "B. Add more sharing rules to distribute the load",
        "C. Defer sharing calculations and run them during off-peak hours",
        "D. Change OWD from Private to Public Read Only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "For large data volumes, deferring sharing calculations allows batch processing during off-peak hours. Owner-based rules don't necessarily perform better than criteria-based. Adding more rules increases calculation time. Changing OWD might not meet security requirements."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "topic": "Groups",
      "question": "Which type of group can contain other groups as members?",
      "options": [
        "A. Public Groups only",
        "B. Queues only",
        "C. Both Public Groups and Queues",
        "D. Neither Public Groups nor Queues"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Both Public Groups and Queues can contain other Public Groups as members, allowing for nested group structures. This enables flexible, hierarchical sharing configurations."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "topic": "Manual Sharing",
      "question": "When is manual sharing automatically deleted?",
      "options": [
        "A. When the record owner's role changes",
        "B. When the record owner changes",
        "C. When sharing rules are recalculated",
        "D. When the shared user is deactivated"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Manual sharing records are automatically deleted when record ownership changes. This is important for maintaining data security and is a key consideration when designing sharing models."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "topic": "OWD Settings",
      "question": "Which OWD setting provides Read access to all users but restricts Edit and Delete to owners and users higher in the hierarchy?",
      "options": [
        "A. Private",
        "B. Public Read Only",
        "C. Public Read/Write",
        "D. Controlled by Parent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Public Read Only allows all users to view records but only owners (and those above them in the hierarchy, if enabled) can edit. Public Read/Write would also grant edit access to everyone."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "topic": "Controlled by Parent",
      "question": "Which objects can have their OWD set to 'Controlled by Parent'?",
      "options": [
        "A. Any object with a lookup relationship",
        "B. Only objects with a master-detail relationship",
        "C. Any custom object",
        "D. Only Contact and Opportunity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Only objects on the detail side of a master-detail relationship can use 'Controlled by Parent' OWD. The child object inherits sharing from the master object."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "topic": "Sharing Troubleshooting",
      "question": "A user reports they cannot see a record they should have access to. Which tool should be used first to diagnose the issue?",
      "options": [
        "A. Debug Logs",
        "B. Sharing Hierarchy button on the record",
        "C. Login As the user",
        "D. SOQL query on Share object"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "The Sharing Hierarchy button (or Sharing button) on a record shows why users have access and at what level. This is the fastest way to diagnose sharing issues without technical queries."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "topic": "Apex Sharing",
      "question": "What is the RowCause field used for in a Share object record?",
      "options": [
        "A. To specify the access level (Read/Edit)",
        "B. To identify why the sharing record exists",
        "C. To link to the parent record",
        "D. To set the sharing expiration date"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "RowCause indicates why a sharing record exists (e.g., 'Owner', 'Rule', 'Manual', or custom Apex sharing reasons). This helps administrators understand and troubleshoot sharing."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "topic": "Large Data Volume",
      "question": "Which sharing approach performs best with very large data volumes (100M+ records)?",
      "options": [
        "A. Criteria-based sharing rules",
        "B. Owner-based sharing rules",
        "C. Programmatic sharing with Apex",
        "D. Public Read Only OWD with restricted profiles"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "With very large data volumes, opening up OWD to Public Read Only and using profiles/permission sets to restrict access is often more performant than complex sharing rules. This reduces the number of sharing records that need to be calculated and maintained."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "topic": "Sharing Sets",
      "question": "Sharing Sets are used to grant record access to which type of users?",
      "options": [
        "A. Internal users based on role",
        "B. Portal or Community users based on their account or contact",
        "C. Guest users on public sites",
        "D. Users in a specific public group"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Sharing Sets grant portal/community users access to records associated with their Account or Contact. They're essential for community sharing architecture."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "topic": "Share Groups",
      "question": "What is a Share Group in the context of Communities/Experience Cloud?",
      "options": [
        "A. A public group used in sharing rules",
        "B. A system-generated group that includes all users who have access to a record",
        "C. A group that allows sharing between internal users and community members",
        "D. A group containing all portal users from one account"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Share Groups enable sharing records between internal users and external community members. They bridge the gap between internal org sharing and community access."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "topic": "Super User Access",
      "question": "What does enabling Super User Access in a community allow partner users to do?",
      "options": [
        "A. Access all records in the org",
        "B. Access records owned by other partner users from the same account",
        "C. Bypass all sharing rules",
        "D. Grant sharing access to other users"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Super User Access allows designated partner community users to access records owned by other partner users from the same Account, without requiring additional sharing configuration."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "topic": "Restriction Rules",
      "question": "What do Restriction Rules do?",
      "options": [
        "A. Grant additional access to records matching criteria",
        "B. Remove access to records matching criteria even if sharing would otherwise allow it",
        "C. Restrict users from creating records matching criteria",
        "D. Apply field-level security based on record values"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Restriction Rules deny access to records matching specified criteria, even if the user would otherwise have access through sharing. They 'tighten' rather than 'open' access."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "topic": "Scoping Rules",
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of Scoping Rules?",
      "options": [
        "A. To restrict record access for certain users",
        "B. To grant additional record access",
        "C. To filter the default records shown in list views and searches",
        "D. To define which records trigger automation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Scoping Rules filter which records appear by default in list views, lookups, and searches without affecting actual record access. Users can still access records outside their scope via direct links."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "topic": "Implicit Sharing",
      "question": "Which scenario describes parent implicit sharing?",
      "options": [
        "A. A Contact owner gets Read access to the parent Account",
        "B. An Account owner gets Read access to child Opportunities",
        "C. An Opportunity owner gets Read access to OpportunityLineItems",
        "D. A Case owner gets Read access to child CaseComments"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Parent implicit sharing grants the Account owner Read access to child Opportunities and Cases. Child implicit sharing is the reverse - Contact/Opportunity owners get Read access to the parent Account."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "topic": "Sharing Rule Limits",
      "question": "What is the combined limit for owner-based and criteria-based sharing rules per object?",
      "options": [
        "A. 50",
        "B. 100",
        "C. 300",
        "D. 500"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The limit is 300 total sharing rules per object (owner-based + criteria-based combined). This is an important consideration when designing complex sharing models."

      "id": 23,
      "topic": "Account Teams",
      "question": "What happens to Account Team members' access when the Account owner changes?",
      "options": [
        "A. Team members retain their access",
        "B. Team members lose all access",
        "C. Team members' access level is downgraded to Read Only",
        "D. Team membership is transferred to the new owner's default team"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Account Team sharing is deleted when Account ownership changes, similar to manual sharing. The new owner must recreate the team if needed."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "topic": "View All / Modify All",
      "question": "A user has 'View All' permission for Accounts. Which statement is TRUE?",
      "options": [
        "A. They can edit all Account records",
        "B. They can see all Account records regardless of sharing",
        "C. They can delete all Account records",
        "D. They can transfer ownership of all Account records"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "'View All' grants read access to all records of that object, bypassing sharing rules and OWD settings. It does not grant edit, delete, or transfer permissions."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "topic": "Guest User Sharing",
      "question": "Which feature was introduced to secure Guest User access to records?",
      "options": [
        "A. Guest User Sharing Rules",
        "B. Secure Guest User Record Access",
        "C. Guest User Profiles",
        "D. Public Access Settings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Guest User Sharing Rules were introduced to explicitly grant access to unauthenticated (guest) users. Without these rules, guest users cannot access records even if OWD is Public."
    },
    {
      "id": 26,
      "topic": "Sharing Architecture",
      "question": "A company needs sales reps to see Accounts in their territory but not edit them, while Account executives can edit Accounts they own. What is the recommended OWD?",
      "options": [
        "A. Private",
        "B. Public Read Only",
        "C. Public Read/Write",
        "D. Controlled by Parent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "Private OWD gives owners edit access by default. Sharing rules or Territory Management can then grant Read-only access to others (sales reps in territories). Public Read Only would give everyone read access, which may be too broad."
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "topic": "Apex Sharing Reason",
      "question": "Why would you use a custom Apex Sharing Reason instead of manual sharing?",
      "options": [
        "A. To improve query performance",
        "B. To prevent sharing from being deleted when ownership changes",
        "C. To bypass OWD restrictions",
        "D. To share records with external users"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Apex sharing with custom reasons persists through ownership changes, unlike manual sharing. This is critical when business logic requires persistent sharing regardless of owner."
    },
    {
      "id": 28,
      "topic": "External OWD",
      "question": "What does setting an External OWD to Private while Internal OWD is Public Read Only accomplish?",
      "options": [
        "A. External users can see all records, internal users cannot",
        "B. Internal users can see all records, external users need explicit sharing",
        "C. Both internal and external users need explicit sharing",
        "D. External users are blocked from the object entirely"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "External OWD can be more restrictive than Internal OWD. This allows internal users to see all records while requiring explicit sharing rules or other mechanisms for external (community) users."

    {
      "id": 29,
      "topic": "Group Membership Operations",
      "question": "A sharing rule shares Opportunities with a public group. A new user is added to the group. When will they gain access?",
      "options": [
        "A. Immediately upon being added",
        "B. After the next sharing recalculation",
        "C. After the user logs out and back in",
        "D. After an admin manually refreshes sharing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A",
      "explanation": "When a user is added to a group, they immediately gain access provided by sharing rules targeting that group. No recalculation or refresh is required."

      "topic": "Record Access Calculation",
      "question": "In which order does Salesforce evaluate record access?",
      "options": [
        "A. Profile → OWD → Sharing Rules → Role Hierarchy",
        "B. OWD → Role Hierarchy → Sharing Rules → Manual Sharing",
        "C. Object Permissions → OWD → Role Hierarchy → Sharing Rules → Manual/Apex Sharing",
        "D. Sharing Rules → OWD → Profile → Role Hierarchy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Salesforce first checks object permissions (can the user access this object at all?), then OWD sets the baseline, role hierarchy opens up access, then sharing rules, and finally manual/apex sharing. Access is cumulative - it only opens up, never restricts (except Restriction Rules)."

      "id": 31,
      "topic": "Field-Level Security",
      "question": "A user has Read access to an Account via sharing but cannot see the Revenue field. What is the most likely cause?",
      "options": [
        "A. The sharing rule doesn't include the Revenue field",
        "B. Field-Level Security restricts the field on their profile",
        "C. The Account OWD is set to Private",
        "D. The Revenue field has a validation rule"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Field-Level Security (FLS) is independent of sharing. Even if a user has record access, they cannot see fields restricted by FLS on their profile or permission sets."

        "C. Role Hierarchy",
        "D. Sharing Rules targeting their associated Account"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "High-Volume Portal users don't have roles and aren't in the role hierarchy. They rely on Sharing Sets, Share Groups, and specific sharing rules instead."

      "topic": "Opportunity Splits",
      "question": "When Opportunity Splits are enabled, who automatically gains access to the Opportunity?",
      "options": [
        "A. Only users on Revenue splits",
        "B. Only users on Overlay splits",
        "C. All users included in any split type",
        "D. No one gains access through splits alone"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "All users included in Opportunity Splits (Revenue or Overlay) automatically receive Read access to the Opportunity, which facilitates sales team collaboration."

      "question": "A user can see a Dashboard but cannot view the underlying report data. What should be checked?",
      "options": [
        "A. Dashboard folder access",
        "B. Report folder access and record-level sharing",
        "C. User's Salesforce license type",
        "D. Dashboard running user settings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Users need access to both the report folder AND the underlying records. If they lack record access, they'll see the dashboard structure but limited or no data. The dashboard's 'Run As' setting can also affect this."

      "id": 35,
      "topic": "Sharing Set Access Mapping",
      "question": "In a Sharing Set, what does the Access Mapping define?",
      "options": [
        "A. Which profiles can use the sharing set",

        "D. Which fields the user can see"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Access Mapping in a Sharing Set defines how to identify which records to share - typically by matching the portal user's Contact or Account to a field on the target object."

      "id": 36,
      "topic": "Data Skew",
      "question": "What is Account Data Skew and why does it affect sharing?",
